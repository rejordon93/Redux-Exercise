Mood Changer App with Redux - GitHub Setup
1. Create a New Repository on GitHub
Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
Give your repository a name (e.g., "mood-changer-redux").
Choose your preferred settings and create the repository.
2. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Run the following command, replacing username with your GitHub username and repository-name with the repository name you created:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Navigate into the cloned repository:
bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
3. Add the Starter Files
Place your index.html, styles.css, and script.js files into the cloned repository directory.
4. Commit and Push Changes
Initialize the repository:
bash
Copy code
git init
Add the files to the staging area:
bash
Copy code
git add .
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Set the remote origin to your GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Push the code to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
5. Create a README.md File
Create a new file in the repository root directory named README.md.
Open the README.md file and add content to describe your project. You can use the README content I provided earlier as a starting point.
6. Push the README Changes
Add the README file to the staging area:
bash
Copy code
git add README.md
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add README"
Push the changes to GitHub:

git push
7. Check Your GitHub Repository
Refresh your GitHub repository page.
You should now see your project files and the README description.
Your Mood Changer app with Redux is now hosted on GitHub! Users can access your code and follow the README instructions to understand and run the app.

Remember to keep your GitHub repository updated as you make changes to your app or want to add new features. You can push changes to the repository using the git add, git commit, and git push commands as demonstrated earlier.
